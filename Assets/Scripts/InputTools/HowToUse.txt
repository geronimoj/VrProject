How to Use:
//////////////////////////////
// Setting up OGInputGetter //
//////////////////////////////
Drag the OGInputGetter onto a gameObject such as the EventSystem, there must be 1 in the scene at all times and only 1.
You do not need a reference to the OGInputGetter. All the Input based functions are static.

You will need to assign the values for the controls as well as what each button maps to on the OGInputGetter.

//////////////////////////////
// Getting Canvases To Work //
//////////////////////////////
Canvases will not work by default as you had to remove the Graphics Raycaster and Standalone Input Moduel
when setting up for VR. 
1. Start off by dragging the EditorDebugging script onto an empty gameObject such as the EventSystem.
2. Add the Standalone Input Module to the EventSystem and Graphics Raycaster to any canvases with interactable elements (buttons, etc)
3. Put your UI in the UI array on the EditorDebugging script and EventSystem to the EventSystem.

The EditorDebugging script basically just disables and enables the OVR scripts and original unity scripts depending on build

/////////////////////////////
// Controlling the Pointer //
/////////////////////////////
To simulate the head and camera we will use the OGControllerSimulator.
1. Add an OGControllerSimulator component to the OVRCameraRig.
2. Assign the RightHandAnchor to the Pointer on OGControllerSimulator.

Notes: Start Rotate how close to the edge of the screen (as a percentage of the screen size) the cursor must
	be before rotating starts.
